# BoomBikes Sharing - Multiple Linear Regression Assignment with RFE and MinMax Scaling

## Introduction

Welcome to the BoomBikes sharing project! In this assignment, we will build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The goal is to help BoomBikes understand the factors influencing bike demand in the American market post-lockdown.

## Problem Statement

A bike-sharing system allows individuals to borrow bikes on a short-term basis for a fee or free of charge. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, BoomBikes has faced significant revenue declines. To prepare for the economic recovery, they want to develop strategies to accelerate revenue growth once lockdown restrictions ease.

BoomBikes has gathered a comprehensive dataset on daily bike demands across various factors, including meteorological surveys and other variables. The objective is to:

- Identify significant variables that predict bike demand.
- Evaluate how these variables impact bike demand.

### Business Goal

The project aims to model bike demand using available independent variables. This will enable BoomBikes to:

- Predict bike demand based on different features.
- Optimize business strategies to meet customer expectations and market demands.
- Gain insights into demand dynamics for potential market expansion.

## Data Description

The dataset provided includes daily bike demand data along with several independent variables that may influence demand. Here are the key features included in the dataset:

- Feature 1: Description of feature 1.
- Feature 2: Description of feature 2.
- ...
- Feature n: Description of feature n.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables if necessary.
   - Scale numerical variables using MinMax scaling.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select significant features for the model.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Build a multiple linear regression model using selected features.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

4. **Model Interpretation:**
   - Interpret the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of each feature on bike demand.

## Implementation

The project will be implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Python. Below is a high-level outline of the notebook structure:

1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Selection using RFE
4. Model Building and Evaluation
5. Conclusion and Recommendations

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, we aim to provide BoomBikes with insights into the factors driving bike demand post-lockdown. This information will guide them in devising effective strategies to enhance their market position and profitability.
